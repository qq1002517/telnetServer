# telnetServer
thi is a telnetServer with java.  
you need jdk1.8 to run it .  
test it with command javac Demo.java  & java Demo  
then use chorme type http://127.0.0.1:19001 ,but this is not web server ,you  just get a welcome.   
   
     
you need a telnet client we suggest xshell  or other linux command .  
type ""telnet 127.0.0.1 19001"" ,you can see the welcome.  
type ""new"" make a new account.  
when you login suc  
you can type :[msg] like "":hello world"" send a message to every one ,  
also you can type 2[user]:[msg] like ""2admin:hello admin"" to talk with admin  

that's all ,luck!
